# The 'Array' Project.

In this project I'm doing some 'Array' projects using JavaScript and trying to improve it as much as possible.

First I tried to get the avarage number of an already set number of grades.

After that I used loops to improve it.

As the project keep going day by day, my objective is the make something out of something as basic as studying something random, and taking something out of it.

As for now, I can see this small project finishing as:
1. Making the avarage of a not-set number of variables, probably using the push() method.
2. For now I can think of a few methods, and I'm not certain which one i'll chose yet (Maybe, and probably, I'll do all of the methods to train my skills).

- Those methods are:
```
Push
Concat
Length Property
Splice
Loop ? (Dunno if I can use it to an endless number of variables)
```
